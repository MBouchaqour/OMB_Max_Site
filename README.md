## FIT/NSF Blockchain for Grants Payments
* [Org Owner] FIT/NSF.
* [POC] Tammie Johnson - tammie.johnson@fiscal.treasury.gov; Craig Fischer (NONFED) - cfischer@think-dragon.com
* [Description] FIT/NSF’s “Blockchain for Grant Payments” initiative strives to improve grant payment processes and increase transparency for multi-tiered grant payments. Since 2017, “Blockchain for Grant Payments” has been focused on how grant recipients could use blockchain technology to tokenize (i.e. digitally represent), transfer, and redeem grant payments. The initiative has led to the creation of a small blockchain proof of concept, the development and testing of a blockchain solution to manage FIT/NSF’s cell phone inventory, and provided hands-on experience with the technology. These activities made it clear that blockchain provides many benefits, including increased transparency, reduced financial and labor burden, and enhanced internal controls. It also demonstrated that using blockchain leads to process efficiencies and increased accuracy. It also provides transparency and peer-to-peer transfers of assets without a third party.

## MITRE Blockchain for Grants Payments

* [Org Owner] MITRE.
* [POC] Jasmine Fauber (NONFED) - jfaubert@mitre.org
* [Description] MITRE is launching a demonstration (proof-of-concept) project to explore whether and to what extent changes in business processes, coupled with use of blockchain (distributed ledger) technology, can streamline administrative burden, improve reporting, and increase transparency in the Grants Management process. The project will develop a working proof-of-concept solution and associated recommendations for solution adoption that address the challenges identified in the previous study (https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/assessing-the-potential-to-improve-grants-management-using-blockchain)

## Recipient Insight

**Note**: There is some term confusion in the industry, and two different things are called "Columnar Databases". Some, listed here, are distributed, persistent databases built around the "key-map" data model: all data has a (possibly composite) key, with which a map of key-value pairs is associated. In some systems, multiple such value maps can be associated with a key, and these maps are referred to as "column families" (with value map keys being referred to as "columns").

Another group of technologies that can also be called "columnar databases" is distinguished by how it stores data, on disk or in memory -- rather than storing data the traditional way, where all column values for a given key are stored next to each other, "row by row", these systems store all *column* values next to each other. So more work is needed to get all columns for a given key, but less work is needed to get all values for a given column.

The former group is referred to as "key map data model" here. The line between these and the [Key-value Data Model](#key-value-data-model) stores is fairly blurry.

The latter, being more about the storage format than about the data model, is listed under [Columnar Databases](#columnar-databases).

You can read more about this distinction on Prof. Daniel Abadi's blog: [Distinguishing two major types of Column Stores](http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2010/03/distinguishing-two-major-types-of_29.html).
