## FIT/NSF Blockchain for Grants Payments
* [Org Owner] FIT/NSF.
* [POC] Tammie Johnson - tammie.johnson@fiscal.treasury.gov; Craig Fischer (NONFED) - cfischer@think-dragon.com
* [Description] FIT/NSF’s “Blockchain for Grant Payments” initiative strives to improve grant payment processes and increase transparency for multi-tiered grant payments. Since 2017, “Blockchain for Grant Payments” has been focused on how grant recipients could use blockchain technology to tokenize (i.e. digitally represent), transfer, and redeem grant payments. The initiative has led to the creation of a small blockchain proof of concept, the development and testing of a blockchain solution to manage FIT/NSF’s cell phone inventory, and provided hands-on experience with the technology. These activities made it clear that blockchain provides many benefits, including increased transparency, reduced financial and labor burden, and enhanced internal controls. It also demonstrated that using blockchain leads to process efficiencies and increased accuracy. It also provides transparency and peer-to-peer transfers of assets without a third party.

## MITRE Blockchain for Grants Payments

* [Org Owner] MITRE.
* [POC] Jasmine Fauber (NONFED) - jfaubert@mitre.org
* [Description] MITRE is launching a demonstration (proof-of-concept) project to explore whether and to what extent changes in business processes, coupled with use of blockchain (distributed ledger) technology, can streamline administrative burden, improve reporting, and increase transparency in the Grants Management process. The project will develop a working proof-of-concept solution and associated recommendations for solution adoption that address the challenges identified in the previous study (https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/assessing-the-potential-to-improve-grants-management-using-blockchain)

## Single Audit Distiller

* [Org Owner] GSA 10x.
* [POC] Ben Peterson - benjamin.peterson@gsa.gov
* [Description] This is a proof-of-concept module that is a companion to the Distiller. Download any audit pdf from the distiller and run it though this module that reads Single Audit PDFs page by page and extracts findings text and corrective action plans which can be viewed as a csv.

## Single Audit Finding Resolution

* [Org Owner] GSA 10x.
* [POC] Rhys Furreigh
* [Description] The FFR, or SF-425, is a form grantees have to fill out and submit at least four times per year.
To reduce duplicative, error prone data entry this tool fills out more than a quarter of the FFR's fields using data from SAM.gov, where all grant applicants must register before applying for grants.

* [GitHub Code] (https://github.com/18F/federal-grant-reporting/tree/master/single-audit/single_audit)

## Recipient Seamless User Experience (RUX)
* [Org Owner] Grants QSMO.
* [POC] Ben Peterson - benjamin.peterson@gsa.gov
* [Description] RUX is an iterative, multi-year infrastructure transformation to reshape the way recipients interact with federal IT throughout the grant management lifecycle. The RUX Minimally Viable Product (MVP) is a clickable prototype that features a user-specific grants management dashboard.
